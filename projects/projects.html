<h3>Mobile Based Cable Robot</h3>
<p>
    As an undergraduate student working alongside a graduate team, designed a mobile based cable robot on a circular frame.
    The purpose of the project was to create a framework to study the control of such robots. Personal contributions included
    the design and 3D printing of the frame for the robot, and the placement and layout of the connections between the control
    motors and their electronic control systems.
</p>

<h3>Acoustic Metamaterials Research</h3>
<p>
    As an undergraduate, derived the dynamic equations and constructed a state-space model of linear, time-invariant, ordinary differential equations
    to model the frequency response of an attenuating metamaterial. The original model consisted of a one-dimensional, mass-in-mass
    structure connected by springs. This allowed for a proof of concept for a material which would selectively attenuate certain
    resonance frequencies. Once derived, a number of initial conditions and system parameters were used to generate sample responses
    with the use of MATLAB. Finally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed, which allowed users to change the parameters and see
    a visual representation of the system response.
</p>
<p>
    Once the GUI was created, work began in conjunction with the graduate team to find an analagous geometric design in 2D space which
    would achieve similar results to the one-dimensional design. A matrix of cantilever beams was proposed to essentially act as the
    spring elements. The mass of beams themselves coincided with the inner masses and the mass of the supporting matrix represented the
    outer mass objects. The design was transferred to an ANSYS model, and proposed resonances were tested against this model.
</p>

<h3>Closed Loop Irrigation System</h3>
<p>
    As an undergraduate senior capstone, a closed-loop irrigation system was developed to study whether such a system could be feasibly
    scaled into commercial and industrial applications. The work was completed as part of a five person team, with a structured methodology
    applied to the development process.
</p>
<p>
    The final design for the project included an array of moisture sensors which determined the moisture content of the soil. A 3D printed
    coupler and transmission system was fabricated to attach a servo motor to a needle valve, which would allow for precise control of the
    flow rate. This valve controlled the flow of water through tubing originating from a water reservoir and terminating in an drip-style
    irrigation tubing. The control section featured an Arduino nano microcontroller. Once the moisture sensors detected a threshold value,
    the Arduino would direct the servo motor to open the needle valve, allowed flow from the reservoir to the soil.
</p>
<p>
    The control and sensor data were collected and post-processed. Ultimately, it was determined that such a system could readily be
    implemented into small-scale plots, while modifications would allow scaling to commerical and industrial applications.
</p>

<h3>Medical Ventilator</h3>
<p>
    As the technical component supporting a team of residents and physicians from the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) 
    Anesthesiology department, designed the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for a medical ventilator during the height of the
    Coronavirus Pandemic. At the time, there was a shortage of commercial ventilators, and a need pressing need for alternatives.
    The goal of the project was to provide a cheap, open-source alternative to expensive commercial ventilators, while retaining the
    same safety and performance standards.
</p>
<p>
    Using a low pressure air source and readily-sourced pneumatic components, an electrical sensing and control system was designed
    to provide periodic ventilation, complete with safegaurds. The key elements of the PCB were a microcontroller, pressure transducer, and
    transistors to control the solenoid valves. The pressure transducer would sense the pressure load in the lungs, and the microcontroller
    would activate the necessary solenoid valves to provide inspiration and exhalation.
</p>
<p>
    This device was rigorously tested in trials on swine. The ventilator performed comparatively in some aspects to some commerical
    ventilators, and was successfully used to ventilate intubated swine. The device was submitted for patent review and for clinical
    trials in humans, with the intention of submitting the design to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization, given
    the relevant circumstances.
